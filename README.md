# Kaggle-Comp-Predicting-House-Prices
Kaggle competition - house prices advanced regression techniques

1.1 Brief Background
How does a home feature add up to its price tag? Ask a home buyer to describe their dream
house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to
an east-west railroad. But this project's dataset proves that much more influences price
negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
The dataset describes 1460 property sales that had occurred in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and
2010

1.2 Problem Statement
With a huge set of explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in
Ames, Iowa, our goal was to predict the final price of each home.

1.3 Data Description
We have 79 variables; a mix of nominal, ordinal, continuous, and discrete variables. In general,
the 20 continuous variables relate to various area dimensions for each observation, 14 discrete
variables typically quantify the number of items occurring within the house. There are a large
number of categorical variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal) associated with this data set. They range
from 2 to 28 classes with the smallest being STREET (gravel or paved) and the largest being
NEIGHBORHOOD (areas within the Ames city limits). The nominal variables typically identify
various types of dwellings, garages, materials, and environmental conditions while the ordinal
variables typically rate various items within the property.
Most of the variables are exactly the type of information that a typical home buyer would want
to know about a potential property (e.g. When was it built? How big is the lot? How many square
feet of living space is in the dwelling? Is the basement finished? How many bathrooms are there?)
